## Project Title
ZENCASH

## Project Description    

We recognized that while young adults are often financially aware, they often lack accessible tools to turn knowledge into action. This inspired us to design an inclusive FinTech solution tailored to their needs—balancing ease of use with meaningful support. By building features like bucket lists, community engagement, and one-to-one financial guidance, our project bridges the gap between financial awareness and effective financial action.
